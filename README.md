# JavaScript Questions & Answers

### 1) What is the difference between null and undefined?

undefined means a variable is declared but not assigned a value.
null is an intentional empty value set by the developer.

### 2) What is the use of the map() function in JavaScript? How is it different from forEach()?

map() creates a new array by transforming each element.
forEach() just loops through the array and does not return a new array.

### 3) What is the difference between == and ===?

== compares values with type conversion.
=== compares both value and type strictly without conversion.

### 4) What is the significance of async/await in fetching API data?

async/await makes asynchronous code easier to read and write.
It allows API calls to look like synchronous code and simplifies error handling.

### 5) Explain the concept of Scope in JavaScript (Global, Function, Block)

Scope defines where variables are accessible.
Global scope is accessible everywhere, function scope inside a function, and block scope inside {} using let and const.
